# listing

LISTING is a very simple application in development, where the user will create lists of things in general.
Every list the user create is called a collection, a collection of items which compouse each list.
This items have priorities and the option to be marked when it's DONE.

I'm still working on it.

Well, this is actually my first project of this kind.
